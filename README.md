# Mattermost Dataminr Plugin

The Mattermost Dataminr Plugin is a real-time alerting system that integrates Dataminr First Alert API with Mattermost. It continuously polls configured Dataminr backends for new events and posts them directly to designated Mattermost channels, enabling teams to receive critical alerts within their communication platform.

The plugin supports multiple Dataminr backend configurations, each operating independently with its own authentication, polling schedule, and error handling. Alerts are formatted with color coding and embedded media to provide rich, actionable information directly in Mattermost.
